## FYI
This Github Pages uses the template in [this repo](https://github.com/jamigibbs/phantom.git) using Jekyll. However, to use it, it stills needs the following changes:

1. create a new branch and use a pre-push hook.
2. use this hook to push the `_site` folder to the new branch. The `_site` should be [pre-compiled locally](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
3. change the default Github Pages branch to the new created branch.
